### What could be interesting here
Since I usually take notes in Markdown I do publish some of them here; party for myself to have them at hand and have backup.
A few highlights:
 - Check out the config files of my working environment in my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/lehoczkics/dotfiles)
 - Some of my recipes / practices are collected in this [cookbook](https://github.com/lehoczkics/cookbook)
 - Things I use infrequently and find difficult to remember end up in [Knowledge Base repo](https://github.com/lehoczkics/kb)
 - Same for PenTesting and CTF-related notes in [pt](https://github.com/lehoczkics/pt).
